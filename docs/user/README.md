# User Guide

Before using DLTK, make sure you follow the [Administrator Guide](../admin/README.md), in particular the sectons [Configure Users and Roles](../admin/access_control.md) and [Connecting to Environments](../admin/environment/README.md).

This guide is divided into the following sections (**work in progress**):

- [Core Concepts](core/README.md)
- User Guide for DLTK Runtimes
  - [Base](runtime/base.md)
  - [Spark](runtime/spark.md)
- [Example Use Cases](examples.md)
