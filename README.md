# Deep Learning Toolkit for Splunk v4

Deep Learning Toolkit for Splunk (DLTK) is a Splunk App that allows users to better deploy, observe and scale advanced data science and machine learning projects with Splunk. In a cloud-native way, DLTK lets you elastically and dynamically deploy models to CPU and GPU based container environments such as Docker, Kubernetes or OpenShift to run algorithms in libraries like Spark, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Rapids and Dask.

Currently, this project (DLTK v4) is **not yet** released on Splunkbase. However, DLTK v3 is available on [Splunkbase](https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/4607/). DLTK v4 is still under development but will eventually be released. If you want to install DLTK v4 from this repository, please see the [Installation Guide](docs/admin/install.md).
