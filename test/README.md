# Testing

This folder contains the entrypoint script for running tests. It doesn't contain the actual test code. The individual test cases are spread across various python packages in this repository. This entrypoint simply imports all test cases, creates a test suite and runs the tests.

If you are looking for documentation on how to run and create DLTK tests, please see the [Test Guide](../docs/developer/test.md).
