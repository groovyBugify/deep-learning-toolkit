# Testing

This folder contains the entrypoint script for running tests. It does not contain the actual test source code. The indivudual test cases are spread across various python packages in this repository. This entrypoint simply imports all test cases, creates a test suite and runs the tests.

If you are looking for documentation on how to write and run DLTK tests, please refer to the [Test Guide](../docs/test.md).
